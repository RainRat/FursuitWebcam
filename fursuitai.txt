Can RainRattie's AI recognize your fursuit?

The predicted fursuit and its confidence is displayed with the image.

It will always display the best match so even if there's no fursuit or a fursuit not in its training set, it will always display something, usually with low confidence.

Don't have a fursuit? Try a drawing, plush, or an image on your phone.

Nothing on this webcam is streamed or saved.

You can interact with it online at @rainratbot on Telegram

You can teach it at @rainratcrowdsourcebot on Telegram, but the copy on this computer was frozen before this convention, so no changes will be reflected until after the con.

How many fursuits does it know? 657. Message @rainratbot with /activefursuitlist to see them.
